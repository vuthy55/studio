# Sync Online Changelog

All notable changes to the Sync Online feature will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`[IMPROVEMENT]`** Implemented an intelligent redirection flow for new users signing up via a Sync Room invite. The `signUpUser` server action now inspects the room's status during sign-up. New users are only redirected into the room if it is currently active; otherwise, they are safely routed to their profile page, preventing any potential client-side permission errors and creating a more logical user experience.

### Fixed
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a persistent and critical `npm ERESOLVE` dependency conflict that blocked all builds and installations. The root cause was an inability for `npm` to find a compatible version of the `genkit` package that satisfied all of its peer dependencies (e.g., `@genkit-ai/googleai`, `@genkit-ai/firebase`).
    - **Initial Problem:** The `package.json` file used caret (`^`) versioning for `genkit` packages, allowing `npm` to install newer minor versions. This flexibility led to dependency tree conflicts where sub-dependencies had incompatible requirements.
    - **Resolution Strategy:** After several unsuccessful attempts (including aligning versions and using `npm overrides`), the definitive solution was to **pin all `genkit`-related packages to a specific, known-stable version (`1.14.1`)**. By removing the `^` from `package.json` for `genkit`, `@genkit-ai/googleai`, and `genkit-cli`, we eliminated all version ambiguity. This forced `npm` to install a precise, conflict-free set of packages, which successfully resolved the `ERESOLVE` error and stabilized the build process.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a series of critical, cascading build failures that prevented application deployment. The root causes were a combination of fundamental TypeScript type errors and incorrect handling of Next.js server-side rendering (SSR) versus client-side rendering (CSR) logic. Key issues included:
    - **Client-Side API Misuse:** Multiple pages (`/admin`, `/login`, `/profile`, `/feedback`) were attempting to access browser-only APIs (`window.location`, `useSearchParams`) during the server-side build process, leading to `ReferenceError` and `missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout` errors. The definitive fix involved restructuring these pages to isolate all client-dependent logic into dedicated child components, which were then wrapped in a React `<Suspense>` boundary. This ensures that server-side pre-rendering can complete successfully while client-side components load as intended.
    - **TypeScript Type Safety Violations:** Several modules contained type mismatches that blocked compilation. This included importing types from incorrect files, extending interfaces with incompatible properties (e.g., a server-side `FieldValue` vs. a client-side `Date` object for timestamps), and incorrectly defining context provider types that did not account for all possible states (`undefined` in addition to `User | null`). These were resolved by correcting import paths and ensuring type definitions accurately reflected their data structures.
    - **SDK Usage Errors:** Incorrect property names were used when handling errors from the Azure Speech SDK (e.g., `cancellation.ErrorCode`), leading to multiple failed builds. This was resolved by consulting the SDK's documentation and using the correct property names (`AuthenticationFailure`). This reinforces the need for careful API verification over assumption.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a complex regression causing all microphone-based features (`Live Translation`, `Prep Your Vibe`, `Sync Live`) to fail after the first use. The root cause was a flawed state management change in a shared speech recognition service, which created a race condition between the service's internal cleanup and the component's lifecycle cleanup hooks. This resulted in unpredictable behavior, including infinite loops and audio stream leaks. The solution involved standardizing the architecture: the shared service is now solely responsible for the recognition task, while the calling components are responsible for managing the resource lifecycle (creation and cleanup), ensuring a predictable and stable behavior across the entire application.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a critical regression where live translations in Sync Online rooms were failing. Participants were hearing the original untranslated audio instead of the audio in their selected language. The issue was traced to an incorrect helper function being used after a code refactoring, which caused the translation step to be skipped. The fix ensures the correct language code format is passed to the translation service, restoring real-time translation functionality.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a persistent `FirebaseError: The query requires an index` error when fetching the user's referral list. The issue was traced to an unreliable deployment of composite indexes. The query in `getReferredUsers` has been refactored to perform a simple filter on the server and handle sorting on the client-side, eliminating the need for a composite index and ensuring reliable data fetching.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a race condition where the Profile page would display empty fields for `country` and `language` after login, even when data existed in Firestore. The component's local state was initializing with empty data before the user's profile was fully loaded from the central `UserDataContext`. The fix eliminated the problematic local state and now binds the form fields directly to the `UserDataContext`, ensuring the UI is always a direct reflection of the central data store.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a persistent `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions` error that occurred upon user logout. The root cause was a race condition where data-fetching hooks (`fetchUserProfile`) were called after the user's authentication state was cleared but before the component tree fully updated. The fix involved centralizing logout logic in the `UserDataContext` and implementing a state guard to immediately and synchronously block any user-specific data fetches the moment a logout is initiated.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved an infinite loop that occurred when an emcee ended a meeting. A state guard now prevents the component from repeatedly trying to exit, ensuring a clean navigation away from the closed room.
- **`[FIX]`** Resolved a persistent race condition on room entry that caused a "permission denied" error when listening for messages. The logic is now separated to ensure the message listener is only initialized *after* the user's participant status is confirmed, which also resolves the downstream WebChannel errors upon exit.
- **`[FIX]`** Corrected a `ReferenceError` for `where` not being defined by adding the proper import from `firebase/firestore`.
- **`[FIX]`** Prevented old messages from being loaded when a user joins or rejoins a room by querying for messages created after the user's join timestamp.
